# Understanding the Hotel Booking Data
This dataset provides information about hotel reservations from 2015 to 2017 for two types of hotels:

### 1.City Hotel (Urban hotels, likely for business travelers)
### 2.Resort Hotel (Vacation hotels, likely for leisure travelers)
By analyzing this data, we can extract key insights about customer behavior, booking patterns, cancellations, and financial trends.

# 1. Key Observations
### A. Booking Trends
     1.Guests book both City Hotels and Resort Hotels, but we need to check which one is more popular.
     2.Seasonality: Booking volumes vary across monthsâ€”likely peaking during holidays or vacation seasons.
     3.Lead Time: Some guests book months in advance, while others book last minute. This could impact hotel revenue management.

    
# B. Cancellation Patterns
### 1.is_canceled tells us whether a booking was canceled.
### 2.Factors affecting cancellations:
      a.Lead time: The longer the lead time, the more likely a guest is to cancel.
      b.Deposit type: Guests with no deposit might cancel more frequently.
      c.Repeated guests: Likely to cancel less often.
      d.Market segment: Online bookings may have a higher cancellation rate than corporate or direct bookings.
# C. Customer Behavior
    1.Transient guests (individual travelers) dominate bookings.
    2.Some bookings are for families (adults, children, babies), while others are for solo travelers.
    3.Special requests (total_of_special_requests) indicate customer preferences, like room type, extra beds, or parking spaces.
# D. Revenue Insights
    1.adr (Average Daily Rate) helps track revenue per booking.
    2.Higher ADR means higher revenue, but cancellations and seasonal discounts affect the final earnings.
    3.Resort Hotels may have a higher ADR during peak seasons, while City Hotels may have a more stable ADR year-round.
    
# 2. Key Questions for Analysis
    To get the most from this dataset, we should explore:

    1.Which hotel type gets more bookings?
    2.What are the peak months for hotel stays?
    3.What factors influence cancellations?
    4.How does ADR vary between hotel types and seasons?
    5.Do repeated guests behave differently than new guests?
